    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "Certain problem spaces in which the data is inherently very noisy, especially in the realm of bioelectric data, may be hard to interpret for humans. In the case of ECG/EKG signal this is extremely relevant when studying irregular heart rhythms and being able to diagnoise patients with various heart diseases, such as different types of arrhythmia types. This is where machine learning can take advantage of the growing data space and be combined with expert medical opinions in the pursuit of making near flawless diagnoses where detecting these diseases as early as possible is of extreme importance. Each data point in our entire dataset in this project represents 10 seconds of ECG signal of various patients and multiple labels assigned to each one, with plenty of meta-data surrounding the signals as well, such as race and gender. We will perform signal analysis on the data by transforming it into its power spectrum density and use as features the power spectrum values, assuming that there will be reasonable discriminability between the power spectrum among the rhythms of different hearts with different conditions. We will measure performance as the percentage of abnormal rhythms that our classifier is able to detect."

[1] In terms of standard pre-processing, there is no set standard, but the bare minimum involves a low-pass filter to get rid of wandering noise[1] Common feature engineering for ECG signals seems to involve much signal analysis such as DWT, ICA, PSD plots, etc. [1], and then extracted features tend to be fed into linear classifiers, such as SVM models [1], although it is becoming increasingly popular to use neural network based approaches [2]\n",

Then, for commonly mentioned classifirs in this space, such as SVM with linear kernel, we can perform grid searches on these different feature engineering techniques, and to aid us in performing an exhaustive search we plan to use Python's default multi-threading module and assign to each model a grid search 'job' that will look through all of our possible feature engineering methods, and then of course the models actual parameter grid as well. We may look into running this process on a remote server as well so as to not require us to be infront of the computer at all times during grid search jobs. "

In terms of one's data representing the health of their heart, it is of course a huge privacy concern, especially if one does not want their general community to know of their condition. In order to address these issues, we will make sure to anonymize data, although we assume that any public data sets already have this data anonymized, but this may change from country to country with different takes on ethics and sensitive situations like this. In a situation like this as well, being able to create a very robust model, near 100% accuracy in a production setting, is extremely important as well in terms of ethics. If we were a real team of practitioners creating ML models for medical data that will be used by doctors to make diagnoses, then there is an ethical expectation that we do not rush model production so as to be able to just quickly sell our model so we can make money, but rather make sure that we go through a long checklist of testing and being absolutely sure our model would be ready to use in a production setting in diagnosing heart diseases.
